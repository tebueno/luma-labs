## Full Description (~300 words)

### Stop losing sales to misconfigured checkout rules.

Gatekeep lets you create checkout validation rules without writing code—and **test them before they go live**.

Every checkout validation app promises to block bad orders. But what happens when a rule accidentally blocks *good* customers? You lose sales, get support tickets, and scramble to fix it.

**Gatekeep is different.** Our built-in Test Simulator lets you see exactly which rules fire against a mock cart *before* you deploy to production. No more guessing. No more surprises.

### What You Can Do

**Block unwanted orders:**
- PO Box addresses (built-in detection)
- Specific countries, states, or ZIP codes
- Orders below or above cart total thresholds
- Orders with too few or too many items

**Target specific customers:**
- Block or allow by customer tag
- Create VIP-only or wholesale-only rules
- Enforce minimum order values for specific groups

**Build complex logic:**
- Combine conditions with AND/OR operators
- Create rules like: "Block if (PO Box) AND (Cart > $500)"
- No coding required
