# Privacy Policy for Gatekeep

**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Introduction

Gatekeep ("we," "our," or "us") is a Shopify app that enables merchants to create checkout validation rules. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Information from Shopify

When you install Gatekeep, we access the following data from your Shopify store:

- **Store Information:** Your store name, domain, and Shopify store ID
- **Product Information:** Basic product data (read-only access for rule configuration)
- **Customer Tags:** Customer tag data used for validation rules (read-only access)

### Information We Store

- **Session Data:** Authentication tokens to keep you logged into the app
- **Rule Configurations:** The validation rules you create, stored in your Shopify store's metafields

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** store customer personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- We do **not** store payment or financial information
- We do **not** store order history or transaction data
- Customer data is only processed in real-time during checkout validation and is never persisted

## How We Use Information

We use the information we access to:

1. **Provide the Service:** Execute your validation rules at checkout
2. **Maintain the App:** Keep you authenticated and manage your session
3. **Improve the App:** Understand usage patterns to improve functionality (anonymized, aggregated data only)

## Data Processing at Checkout

When a customer checks out on your store:

1. Our Shopify Function receives cart and shipping data from Shopify
2. We evaluate this data against your configured rules
3. We return a pass/fail result to Shopify
4. **No customer data is stored or transmitted outside of Shopify's infrastructure**

All checkout validation happens within Shopify's secure environment using Shopify Functions.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Rule configurations** are stored in Shopify metafields (within your store's data)
- **Session data** is stored in a secure database with encryption at rest
- We use industry-standard security practices to protect all data
- We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties

## Third-Party Services

Gatekeep runs entirely within the Shopify ecosystem. We do not integrate with or share data with any third-party services outside of Shopify.

## Data Retention

- **Session data:** Retained while your app is installed; deleted upon uninstallation
- **Rule configurations:** Stored in your Shopify metafields; you control this data
- Upon app uninstallation, all app-specific data is removed

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** View all rules and configurations you've created
- **Modify:** Edit or delete any rules at any time
- **Delete:** Uninstall the app to remove all associated data
- **Export:** Your rules are stored as JSON and can be viewed in Shopify metafields

## GDPR Compliance

For users in the European Economic Area:

- We process data as a "data processor" on behalf of merchants
- We only process data necessary to provide the service
- We do not transfer data outside the EEA (all processing happens on Shopify's infrastructure)
- You can request data deletion by uninstalling the app

## CCPA Compliance

For California residents:
